# Calling "mint" function in smart contract without metamask

This project can call smart contracts without metamask. Also, by implementing it as an API, it can be called by games like Roblox or various programs.


# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
