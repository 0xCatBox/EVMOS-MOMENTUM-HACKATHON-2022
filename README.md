# Calling "mint" function in smart contract without metamask

This project can call smart contracts without metamask. One URL generates an ERC20 token, and the other URL generates an ERC721 token (NFT).

Also, by implementing it as an API, it can be called by games like Roblox or various programs.


# D-Ad scalability

This is a project carried out for the scalability of the previously produced advertising platform D-Ad.
Rather than limiting D-Ad within the website, we want to increase scalability by connecting it to APIs in other dapps. Therefore, we want to maximize the advertising effect.

npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
